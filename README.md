# Titanic Survival Prediction Project 🚢

This project uses machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on the provided dataset.

## 📁 Files Included

- **Pipeline.ipynb**  
  Builds and trains the machine learning pipeline using the Titanic dataset.

- **Predict.ipynb**  
  Loads the trained pipeline (`pipe.pk`) and makes predictions on new or test data.

- **Titanic.csv**  
  The dataset used for training. Contains passenger information such as age, sex, class, etc.

- **pipe.pk**  
  The serialized (pickled) machine learning pipeline saved using `joblib` or `pickle`.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open `Pipeline.ipynb` to view the data preprocessing and model training steps.
2. Once the model is trained, it is saved as `pipe.pk`.
3. Open `Predict.ipynb` to load the pipeline and run predictions on new data.
